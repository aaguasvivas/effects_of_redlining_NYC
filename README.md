# Effects of Redlining in New York City
Final Project Repository for GOV1005: Data, in which I explore the effects of redlining in New York City during the mid-20th century, and how it affects household income and housing value from 1950 to 2010.

## Project Rationale

HCMST 2017 is intriguing as one of the few datasets from a comprehensive, representative survey of U.S. literate couples.

Though the first "How Couples Meet and Stay Together" survey was conducted by Rosenfeld and his colleagues in 2009, this represents a completely new sample of individuals. The data was collected between July 13 and August 1, 2017, and just released in October of 2018.

How individuals find a partner is a subject of near universal interest - particularly to a young college student witnessing committed relationships, hookups, and everything in between.

With my visualizations, I sought to answer questions related to the different ways in which couples meet.
