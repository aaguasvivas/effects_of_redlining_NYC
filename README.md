# Effects of Redlining in New York City
Final Project Repository for GOV1005: Data, in which I explore the effects of redlining in New York City during the mid-20th century, and how it affects household income and housing value from 1950 to 2010.

## Project Rationale

The desire to work on this project came out of personal experiences. Having moved from the Dominican Republic, to live in the Bronx with my grandmother, and having gone to middle school there for a short period of time, before moving to Newburgh, New York, made me wonder why the borough was set up in the way it was. Why was it that so many of my friends and their families seemed to be pushed to the margins of the city, facing poverty and generations of struggle? In the next few years, I would go on to learn about redlining and its effects, seeing the consequences of this racist and discriminatory practice, first hand. I have always wanted to visualize what these redlining maps looked like, and how it affected the five New York City boroughs over time, from 1950 to 2010. This is what I set my goal to be for this project. My hope is that this project will make information about this practice more readily and widely available, as well as provide a visualization tool, to actually see, in a map, the areas affected.
