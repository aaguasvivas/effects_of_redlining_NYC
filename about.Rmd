# About Draft

#### [Access my Github repository here!](https://github.com/aaguasvivas/MS_4)

For my final project, I want to focus on the history and effects of racism and
discrimination, specifically through redlining. I will look at how redlining
affected the geography of New York City, where I am from. I will be focusing on
the five different boroughs (the Bronx, Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten
Island) and see how the city has been divided. I will use shapefile data from
1937-1940, to look at these divisions, which use different rankings to
categorize geographical locations. These geographical locations were associated
with race, with some of the "hazardous" zones often being those with the highest
Black and Hispanic populations. I will be using census data to determine how
those zones are still affected today, and what the change has been throughout
the last 80 years. My expectation is that the zones that were redlined because
of people of color will be some of the poorest places still today. I expect a
lot of these areas to still have a high concentration of people of color. If
not, I will look to see whether this change from being a city that was redlined,
to now being more wealthy, is one of the results of gentrification. Right now, I
have collected a lot of the map data through shapefiles, which I am not sure how
to work with yet, and I am actively trying to learn about. I am using census
data which we have worked with in class before. I am looking for other sorts of
data that will help me prove my claim or give me some sort of guidance as to
what kinds of observations I can make.

Right now, my plan is to examine this data and talk to my TF, Mitchell, to see
what kinds of comparisons are useful when working with shapefile maps and census
data. Something I am worried about and will keep working through is whether I am
reading and processing this data correctly and whether I will be able to draw
useful observations moving forward. As of right now, I will be using a lot of
what I have mentioned here as part of my future About Page, as well as hopefully
a lot of the data gathered into my raw-data subdirectory. I will be taking the 
datacamp course that focuses on using sf, as well as a few other courses, 
maybe around mapping.

# Datasets Used & Links

I used the following datasets:

- Mapping Inequality Redlining in New Deal America Shapefiles. 
[(here)](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=6/37.484/-79.955&text=downloads)
  - This dataset provides us with accurate visuals of what readlining was like
  from 1937-1940, in the different parts of New York. We have access to several
  different parts of New York, but I have decided to focus on the five boroughs,
  not only because these are the places I am more familiar with being from New
  York, but also because this is where some of the worst redlining in the
  country happened about 80 years ago. I hope to explore this data and compare
  it to recent census data, to see which patterns and observations are relevant
  and important to discuss.
    
- New York City Census Data: Demographic, Economic, and Location Data for 
Census Tracts in NYC. 
[(here)](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/new-york-city-census-data/data)
  - This is the most recent census data I could find which provides huge amounts
  of information, such as where the people live, income levels, education, rate
  of poverty, income per capita, race, gender, among other things. I will use
  this information and compare it to the redlining maps from 80 years ago to see
  whuch patterns have developed because of redlining and how have people been
  affected by it evem 80 years later.

```{r data-processing, include=FALSE}

# Here I will load in and process the maps, as well as the census data.
# First I start off my processing NYC location data.

NY_census_block_loc <- 
  read_csv("raw-data/new-york-city-census-data/census_block_loc.csv", 
           col_names = TRUE) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(county == "Queens" | county == "Bronx" | county == "New York")

# Here, I process a more traditional census dataset/table with lots of
# information, like race, location and income.

NY_census_tracts <-
  read_csv("raw-data/new-york-city-census-data/nyc_census_tracts.csv", 
           col_names = TRUE) %>%
  clean_names()

# Below I create a variable where I read in and process the shapefiles of each
# of the five boroughs, then I use this variable along with ggplot to graph a
# map of the boroughs. The next step would be to creative a comprehensive visual
# of housing segregation in 1937-1940 versus what the low income parts are now
# using the census data.

NY_Bronx_1938 <- 
  st_read("raw-data/NYBronx1938/cartodb-query.shp")

# Progress Update Since Milestone 3:

To complete Milestone 4, I have started by duplicating my Milestone 3 repo, so that I can keep adding to it. I have included my raw data in the "raw-data" subdirectory, and will display some of the code and graphs I hope to be making below. I have included a description of the data I have collected and where it is located in the links above. I plan to compare maps and graphs of redlining from the years 1937 to 1940, comparing it to today, so that we can see the long term effects redlining, racism and discrimination have caused in New York City. I expect to see that most of the places where redlining occurred, are still either very poor, due to the government neglecting these areas, with Black and Latinx minorities making up most of the population, or are becoming gentrified in the case of some places in Brooklyn and elsewhere. I want to explore the impact these types of discriminatory policies have had on the lives of the residents, and how it has hurt them and caused their displacement.
