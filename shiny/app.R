Racial, Ethnic and Religious minorities were often denied housing and business loans, as the Underwriting Manual of the Federal Housing Administration, said that 'incompatible racial groups should not be permitted to live in the same communities'. With this mass migration, White people have the ability to acquire wealth by investing in housing and business, effectively taking these resources and capital away from these urban areas, only worsening the wealth gap between them."),

With moving there, a lot of new businesses also move in, and prices for properties begin to go up, pushing those who can't afford the new prices out, which are often people of color."))

Having moved from the Dominican Republic, to live in the Bronx with my grandmother, and having gone to middle school there for a short period of time, before moving to Newburgh, New York, made me wonder why the borough was set up in the way it was. Why was it that so many of my friends and their families seemed to be pushed to the margins of the city, facing poverty and generations of struggle? In the next few years, I would go on to learn about redlining and its effects, seeing the consequences of this racist and discriminatory practice, first hand. I have always wanted to visualize what these redlining maps looked like, and how it affected the five New York City boroughs over time, from 1950 to 2010. This is what I set my goal to be for this project. My hope is that this project will make information about this practice more readily and widely available, as well as provide a visualization tool, to actually see, in a map, the areas affected."),
